# The Growth of Airbnb

???

Airbnb has grown explosively since its founding in 2008. I expect some or most of you have either stayed in or operated one, and everyone is at least aware of Airbnb as an alternative to conventional hotels.

News and social media are filled with concerns that this growth of short-term rentals is now having harmful impacts on communities throughout the world.

---
# Housing Markets

Barron et al. (2020, p. 45):

> To summarize the state of the literature on home-sharing, research (including this paper) has found that **home-sharing (1) raises local rental rates** by causing a reallocation of the housing stock, (2) **raises house prices** through both the capitalization of rents and the increased ability to use excess capacity...

???

The most well-recognized effects are on housing markets, with many studies finding short-term renting reduces the housing supply and drives prices up for both renters and buyers.

This occurs because property owners find it more profitable to operate an Airbnb than offer conventional rentals, and this profitability has lead some Airbnb operators to purchase additional homes---sometimes dozens---to operate full-time Airbnbs.

# Anti-Social Behaviour

.footnote[Source: [Lazzaro (2017) *The Observer*](https://observer.com/2017/03/airbnb-nda-damage-in-london-after-drug-party/)]


???

Short-term rentals may also contribute to disorder and anti-social behaviour. 

While Airbnb claims these incidents are exceedingly rare, news media abounds with stories---like the one pictured---of nightmare Airbnb guests destroying apartments and parties getting out of hand. We've heard some concerns from police about this as well.

# Destabilization

.image-90[

.footnote[Source: [Kommenda et al. (2020) *The Guardian*](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/feb/20/revealed-the-areas-in-the-uk-with-one-airbnb-for-every-four-homes)]

???

In some markets, like London, Airbnb growth has become extreme: there are neighborhoods where a quarter or more of housing units are dedicated Airbnb properties

We actually estimate as high as 60% in one LSOA in Soho in one quarter.

There are concerns that this concentration is destabilizing communities and changing their character as residents are increasingly transient and anonymous

# Criminological Theory

## and Airbnb

???

Based on all that, criminological theory gives us reasons to expect that the proliferation of Airbnbs will increase crime rates

We focus on two theories in this paper

---
# Routine Activities Theory

![](./img/routine_activity.svg)



* A crime is the result of a criminal .bam[opportunity]

* Anything that creates opportunities will increase crime rates

  * This occurs *rapidly*

???

The first is routine activities theory.

Routine activities theory describes crime as the result of opportunities: convergences of likely offenders and suitable targets in the absence of capable guardians.

When the number of opportunities increases, crime increases immediately.

Airbnb properties may contribute to opportunities in a number of ways

---
# Airbnb and Routine Activity

* Guests as *likely offenders*

   * More prone to anti-social behaviour

--

* Guests as *suitable targets*

   * Often away from residence (e.g., assault, robbery)
   * Less aware of and averse to risky situations
   * Recognizable as high-value targets
--

* Guests as *incapable guardians*

   * Less attached to neighborhood
   * Unfamiliar with residents and local norms
   * Often away from residence (e.g., burglary)

--

.centernote[These should be stronger for *entire properties* than *spare rooms*.]

---
# Social Disorganization



![](./img/social_disorganization.svg)


* Strong neighborhood institutions reduce crime by promoting .bam[social control]

* Destabilizing social structures increases crime by reducing social control

   * This usually occurs *slowly*


???

The second theory is social disorganization.

Social disorganization is a macro-theory of social control that says that sociodemographic advantage and stability promote social control capacity---often operationalized using collective efficacy as we do in the paper

Social control capacity influences criminal opportunity---mainly through guardianship---and tends to be fairly stable over time

Based on social disorganization, we expect Airbnb to increase crime mainly by inducing residential instability

---
## Airbnb and Social Disorganization


Entire properties *replace* longer-term residents with very short-term ones

* Reduces attachment to neighbourhood
* Inhibits social network formation
* Weakens institutions

--

Spare rooms only *add* short-term residents

* Less disruptive
* May promote stability with additional income

---
# Causal Model

# Hypotheses

1. **Airbnb properties are positively related to crime**

2. **Entire properties will be more strongly related to crime than rooms**

3. Airbnb activity will be negatively related to collective efficacy

4. The association between Airbnb activity and crime is partly explained by collective efficacy

# Property Types

Both theories suggest effects should be concentrated in *entire homes and apartments*

???

Our next hypothesis was that criminogenic effects should be more prominent for entire properties, because they reduce guardianship, increase suitability, and destabilize communities more than spare rooms

--

Respecify model with disaggregated Airbnb measures:

* Entire Homes and Apartments

* Private Rooms

* Shared Rooms

---

.image-tall[
![](img/property-results-1.png)
]

???


Here is the same type of plot again, but now I show only contemporaneous effects because the lagged ones are all near-zero again.

As expected, we see the total association is mainly driven by entire properties---though we see a bit of evidence for private rooms and burglary.

This provides support for our second hypothesis.

---
# Summary


Per quarter, each additional Airbnb is associated with...

* 0.03 robberies
* 0.04 burglaries
* 0.16 thefts
* 0.06 violent offenses


???

Okay, let's talk about these results a bit.

We find, per quarter...

... these may seem small in magnitude, but keep in mind many LSOAs have dozens or even upwards of a hundred dedicated Airbnb properties.



We also find these estimates are quite stable (or robust) across different specifications, including different causal timings, Premier league games, spatial clustering, and even excluding Zone 1 of London

# Units of Analysis

Given our models, how should we aggregate data?

--

&zwj;Space:

* Some theoretical debate over spatial scale of social control
* Many respondents needed for reliable measurement

--

&zwj;Time:

* Social control effects are slow
* Changes in social control capacity may be even slower
* Many respondents needed for reliable measurement

--

&zwj;Unit: **Ward-years**

* High CE reliability: 0.71
* Few zeroes but high skew in crime

# Airbnb and Collective Efficacy

How is Airbnb activity related to collective efficacy?

* Estimate both sides of Airbnb and CE cross-lagged model

# Summary

Weak collective efficacy effects

   * Inconsistent with social disorganization

--

Weaker but persistent Airbnb effects

   * Inconsistent with social disorganization
   * More consistent with routine activity
      * Opportunity is contemporaneous and local

--

Airbnb activity may reduce collective efficacy over time

# Implications

Private short-term letting is reshaping the urban landscape

* Increasing apartment rents and home prices
* .bam[Compromising public safety]

???

Let's talk about implications.

--

Short-term letting is highly commercialized

* Primarily dedicated year-round properties
* Dominated by hosts with multiple dedicated properties

--

This is an externality problem

* Benefits accrue to few property owners
* Livability and affordability reduced for all

???

In economic terms, this is an externality problem

--
